# Foreground Seperation

One of the smaller problems in the cultural heritage sector, but one that
"crops" (excuse the pun) often in the Digital Media team in which we work -
if we have an image of an artefact on a background which is different from the
background colour of the website, it involves a mix of manual work and image
editing to cut out the artefact in the foregrounf from the background, so it
can then be placed on a transparent background.

(Our colleagues in our amazing Photostudio department will at this point be
thinking of course this is a solved problem, nowadays they would use layers ???- - ASK TOM)
