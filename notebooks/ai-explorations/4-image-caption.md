# 4. Image Captioning (Credit)

## Problem

### Problem Statement

Generate a one sentance summary description of an image that could be used as a caption/credit

### Background

### Related Problems

For quite a few research papers on this, the following problems and this one are all the same issue, generation of text based
on an image, and it's just a variation of length of text

  * 3-image-caption
  * 4-image-description
  * 5-image-

There are some differences though (for example,

## Problem Variations

### Major Variations

  * 4M1 - Describe the cultural heritage object rather than the image - (e.g. a photo of a watercolour is described as a watercolour)
  * 4M2 - Restrict keywords to those within a particular context (materials, techniques, place, etc)
  * 4M2 - Restrict keywords known to those within a particular vocabulary (AAT, TGN, Iconclass)
  * 4M4 - Combine 2M2 and 2M3

### Minor Variations

  * 2m1 - Output the keywords in multiple languages
  * 2m2 - If the image contains people, assign names to them instead of just labelling them as people
