# 2. Image Classification

## Problem 

### Problem Statement

"Generate keywords describing the content of a digital image"

### Background

A fairly obvious issue not specific to cultural heritage, to generate relevant text keywords describing the main features
of the image. For cultural heritage objects (as often the case, mostly research is aimed on paintings) the 

### Related Problems

For quite a few research papers on this, the following problems and this one are all the same issue, generation of text based
on an image, and it's just a variation of length of text

  * 
  * 3-image-caption
  * 4-image-description
  * 5-image-

There are some differences though (for example, 

  * Keywords can then be used as part of with image classification, retrieval,
  * Keywords can be the base of

## Problem Variations

### Major Variations

  * 2/A - Describe the cultural heritage object rather than the image - (e.g. the digital image of a watercolour is described as a watercolour)
  * 2/B - Restrict classification to that within a particular context (materials, techniques, place, etc)
  * 2/C - Restrict classification known to those within a particular vocabulary (AAT, TGN, Iconclass)
  * 2/D - Combine 2M2 and 2M3

### Minor Variations

  * 2/a - Output the keywords in multiple languages

### Type Specific Variations

  * 2/1 - Paintings Specific keywords

## Resources
