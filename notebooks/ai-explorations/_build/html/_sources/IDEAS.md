# Notebook Ideas

Different types of projects

  * AN idea
  * A test of some software / model 
  * A test of a new version of software model

So could have some explorations that are

Data Explorations with AI

  * 

AI Explorations with data


Both of which could have multiple versions (one oer year ?( showing how running
the same notebook with later software/model improves (or not) the output, e.g. GPT3.5 vs GPT4.

  * OCR / HTR

IDEAS

One idea, which has a summary notebook stating the project and current best results, then at least one implemention notebook but potentially multiple (if time allows) notebook implementations (one per tool or approach (if a new paper advises on tweaking params in a new way for example), which might have multiple versions each (one per code release/year)

Cultural heritage Domain Problems (General)

  * 1 - Background seperation
  * 2 - Image/Museum Object keyword geenration
  * 3 - Image Caption Generation (of the image)
  * 4 - Image Description Generation (of the image)
  * 5 - Object detection in artworks - Simple object feature detection in different types of objects - painting, stained glass, tapestries, etc - using multiple models ?
  * 5.1 Cultural Heritage Object description generation (from the image of the museum object)
  * 5.1 - People detection in artworks (subset of object detection) 
  * 6 - Object classification in artworks - image level
  * 7 - Visual relationship between objects in artworks 
  * 8 - Pose detection in artworks 
  * 9 - Style/Genre Detection
  * 10 - Icongraphy classifiction in artworks - image level
  * 11 - Icongraphy classifiction in artworks - pixel (bounded box) level
  * 12 - Visual Link Retrieval - Identify visual patterns shared between artworks
  * 13 - Text Extraction from writtem material OCR/HTR tools on a document type (letters, playbills, etc)
  * 14 - Structured Information Etxracrtion - test on letters, account books, diaries to data vis
  * 15 - Entity Extraction from records - populate other fields, validatation (material named before existed)
  * 16 - Emotion Detection
  * 17 - Artist/Maker Detection
  * 17.1 - Bronze Vessel Classification
  * 18 - Detecting re-used content - woodblock prints re-used in multiple books
  * 19 - Digital heritage restoration - restoring ?
  * 21 - Visual Question Answering Natural language question answer AI - chat with AI about an artefact

Possibly just implementations not challenges
  * 20 - Multimodal Retrieval (text + vision) [ is this just


  * Collecting mistakes in above as reference

Cultural Heritage Domain Problems (Location Specific)

  * Identify an object in a gallery 
  * Location in a gallery based on whats around you

Cultural Heritage Domain Problems (Object Specific)

  * Scribal Hand detection in handwritten material
  * Artist/Maker Detection (may vary)

Cultural Heritage Domain Problems (Heritage Science Specific)

Cultural Heritage Domain Problems (Library Specific)
  * Library - Book cataloguing (Finnish Library project)

Reference

  * Common tools used in cultural heritage AI
  * Common datasets used in cultural heritage AI

Not Covered

  Generative Image AI - too close to creating artworks / controversial
  AI for videos - not our area

Image Explorations ?

  * 

Notebook Types

  - Datasets (chronological)

  - Models (chronological) - GLAM specific

  - Overview papers - State of the art etc in GLAM

  - Overview papres - State of the art in AI (non-GLAM)

  - Domain Problems 
    - Notebook stating problem, bibliography, state of the art, best results 
    - Lab Notebooks running problem through different models/data/tuning with versioning of same models/data to show change over time
