# AI (Cultural Heritage) Explorations

These are a set of notebooks explioring some of the common tasks in
cultural heritage that AI may (or already is) have an impact. Each
base notebook provides:

  * An overview of a problem
  * A sample AI implemnentation
  * Multiple implementations testing different models and datasets to get different(ideally better) results
  * Test datasets
  * Environmental/Ethical/Economic and Social Impact Assesments (as much possible)
  * Bibliography and Research Activity

In addition, there are variation notebooks on the base notebooks (major and minor variations, in our opinion alone) which are also set out. There are also some specific use cases related to a base notebook that are explored, for example
identifying style of patterns in ceramics from early China is a specific use case of the base notebook *content re-use*.

However it should be noted this is not an attempt to be comprehensive overview
of AI and cultural heritage, it is instead meant as a guide for anyone 
(including ourselves) in the cultural heritage sector as to what is possible 
,and useful, from the latest developments in AI.

Because of the V&A collections, we are interested in most areas of the arts
in relation to AI, but areas of AI we are not focused on are:

  * Generative AI for new artworks
  * Video recognition
  * Virtual Chat Bot (the virtual Leonardo, William Morris, etc)

## Terminology Notes

There is an unfortunate clash in terminology between the domains of cultural heritage and image processing/machine learning over the word "objects". In cultural heritage that would refer to the physical objects (usually in a museum collection but sometimes also used for archives items and library holdings), whereas in image processing/machine learning it refers in an image to any identifiable part of a scene, a tree in a landscape, a book on a table, a cat on a hat, etc. To try to avoid confusion, we use the phrase "cultural heritage object" for the former and add quotes around "object" to use in the second sense. 

There is further confusion in the cultural heritage domain between an image/media of a cultural heritage object and the cultural heritage object itself which sometimes muddles up what is being discussed. As much as possible we use the phrasing "digital image" or "digital media" for the former and "cultural heritage object" to mean the object itself, not representations of it. But this is a hard practice to stick to at all times. Born Digital objects bring in a whole new angle on this problem, but at the moment are not covered here.

The word "annotations" is used with so many slightly different meanings in both cultural heritage and image processing/machine learning that it is avoided here wherever possible. It is similiar situation with the word "collections" but it is unavoidable.
