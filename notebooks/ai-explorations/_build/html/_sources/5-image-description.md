# 5. Image Descriptions

## Problem 

### Problem Statement

Generate a description of an image of a cultural heritage object varying length from a paragraph summary of the object to a comprehensive monograph about the object giving all possible knowledge about it, from its creation to its contents.

### Background 

### Related Problems

For quite a few research papers on this, the following problems and this one are all the same issue, generation of text based
on an image, and it's just a variation of length of text

  * 2-image-caption
  * 3-image-description
  * 4-image-

There are some differences though (for example,

## Problem Variations

### Major Variations

  * 2/A - Describe the cultural heritage object rather than the image - (e.g. a photo of a watercolour is described as a watercolour instead of just the contents)
  * 2/B - Restrict keywords to those within a particular context (materials, techniques, place, etc)
  * 2/C - Restrict keywords known to those within a particular vocabulary (AAT, TGN, Iconclass)
  * 2/D - Combine 2M2 and 2M3

### Minor Variations

  * 2/1 - Output the keywords in multiple languages
  * 2/2 - if the image contains people, give names to them
