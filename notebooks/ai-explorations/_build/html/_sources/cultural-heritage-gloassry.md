# Cultural Heritage Glossary

A glossary of some (in no way attempting to be compresensive) terms and how
they are being used in this site.

## Cultural Heritage Object

## Object 

Some set of pixels isolatable in a digital image from the rest of the image 
which is an object class of any kind (tree, cat, bike, etc). 

## Annotations

Sometimes refers to area of an image that have been labelled as containing some *Object*.  Used as part of model training so it can learn to label new images with any objects from its training set

Also known as: bounding box, pixel level, localised

[If I could make an appeal to the world, please stop using the word 
annotations for a while, it's already used in so many domains with so many clashing meanings, we don't need any more ]
