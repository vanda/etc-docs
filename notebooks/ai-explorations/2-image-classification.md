# 2. Image Classification

## Challenge 

### Problem Statement

"Generate keywords describing the content of a digital image"

### Background

A fairly obvious issue not specific to cultural heritage, to generate relevant text keywords describing the main features
of the image. For cultural heritage objects (by which mostly the research refers to paintings) the keywords can refer
to the cultural heritage object itself ('an engraving') and any content/features/objects of the object ('centaurs', 'Hercules').

### Related Problems

For much research, the following problems are all the same issue, the generation of a length of text based on an image,
with the following variations

  * (this problem)
  * 3-image-labelling
  * 4-image-caption
  * 5-image-description

There are some differences though, especially in what the outputs of the implementation can then be used for. For example: 

  * Keywords can then be used as part of with image classification, retrieval,

Some researchers also do explictily focus on one area, for example generating a full multi paragraph description as opposed to a single sentance caption, or generating a grammatical sentence (a caption) instead of a series of classes (labelling) (e.g. "An etching depicting Hercules fighting centaurs" as opposed to "etching, centaurs, Hercules"). It is not always clear in research papers though if the same meaning applies - for some "etching, centaurs, hercules" is considered a caption.

## Problem Variations

### Major Variations

  * 2/A - Describe the cultural heritage object rather than the image - (e.g. the digital image of a watercolour is described as a watercolour)
  * 2/B - Restrict classification to that within a particular context (materials, techniques, place, etc)
  * 2/C - Restrict classification known to those within a particular vocabulary (AAT, TGN, Iconclass)
  * 2/D - Combine 2M2 and 2M3

### Minor Variations

  * 2/a - Output the keywords in multiple languages

### Type Specific Variations

  * 2/1 - Paintings Specific keywords

## Resources

### Datasets

Particular artworks that would be very hard challenges for this problem

### Complex 

Recording some particularly complex challenges a particalar cultural heritage object might present for solutions to this problem.
