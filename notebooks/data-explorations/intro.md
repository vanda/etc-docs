Introduction
============================

This is a collection of worked examples exploring the V&A collections using the [V&A Collections API](https://developers.vam.ac.uk/guide/v2/)
often combined with another institutions' collections' data, APIs or research projects. The examples started out as data tests for our new API
during its development but have expanded since then in strange and hopefully interesting ways.

The site's technical build uses:
  * [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
  * [Jupyter Book](jupyterbook.org/)
  * [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Altair](altair-viz.github.io/)
  * [A modified version of Ivpy](https://github.com/atiro/ivpy)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * and various other libraries mentioned in individual explorations.

and the examples feature the collections data and images of the [V&A](https://www.vam.ac.uk) and:
  * [National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh](https://nls.uk) (Exploration 1)
  * [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago](https://artic.edu/) (Exploration 2)
  * [British Library, London](https://bl.uk) (Exploration 3)
  * [Birmingham Museums, Birmingham](https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/) (Exploration 4)
  * [BBC, London)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) (Exploration 5)
  * [Chester Beatty Library, Dublin](https://chesterbeatty.ie/) (Exploration 7)
  * [The Met, New York](https://www.metmuseum.org/) (Exploration 8)
  * [Science Museum, London](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/home) (Exploration 10)
  * [Wellcome Collection, London](https://wellcomecollection.org/) (Exploration 11)
  * [Louve, Paris](https://www.louvre.fr/) (Exploration 12 - Work in Progress)
  * [Smithonsian Museums, Washington D.C] (whose own data explorations we took the name from)

No art historical conclusions should be drawn from these elaborate yet tenuous examples of data scienceish techniques
applied to cultural heritage collections, but we hope they provide some ideas for other interesting explorations.

We are keen to record examples of usage of our API, please let us know if you have built an app or notebook making use of it
via an [Issue](https://github.com/vanda/etc-docs/issues) in our github [repository](https://github.com/vanda/etc-docs/).
