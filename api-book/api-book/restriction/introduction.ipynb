    "Be aware that many objects have uncertain production dates; the further back in time the larger this production date uncertainty is likely to be. For example, an object made in the 16th century might only have an estimated date to within the century or half century range. This means there are often two ranges that need to be compared, the range you specify in the query and the range of the objects production date. We include in the response any object records where these two ranges overlap, even if it's just by a year. For example, if you query for any objects made from 1700 to 1750, an object with a estimated production date range of 1650 to 1700 would be included in the returned object records.\n",
