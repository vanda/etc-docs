    "(N.B. As each object record can contain dozens of fields, each of those can be considered \"a data point\". The usage of the term in this context is that of visualisation of a single field from the object record, so a single record would just have a single data point).\n",

    "A single object record will need to be examined individually, either by looking at the human readable object page on our [collections site](https://collections.vam.ac.uk), or by processing in some way the full object record. There may be more useful ways to display this single object record within an environment such as Jupyter in some summary form, but to display the complete object record would effectively require recreating the existing object pages.\n",

    "A set of records returned from a response to a {ref}`searching:top` or {ref}`filtering:top` can be shown in a variety of graphical visualisation, using a library such as [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/). The type of graph used will depend on the data you are looking to show and what you would like to discover in the results. See some example in {ref}`quickstart:top`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Sets of Object Records\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger number of records may be to difficult to show in a meaningful way in a single visualisation, so more abstracted visualisations may be used. In this case {ref}`clustering:top` endpoints may be more useful to return summary statistics for a query (e.g. counts of different types of materials in use in objects matching on a query). This allows high-level exploration of a large number of records, which can then provide an indication of a smaller subset that might be useful to examine using other visualisation techniques.\n"
