    "The V&A Collections API provides access to the collections data and images held by the [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) in machine readable formats (currently JSON and CSV) aiding research into art & design history, provenance studies and supporting general data science exploration and visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first API was released in 2009, this second version released in 2021 follows its pioneering predecessor in many ways, but provides some new functionality allowing for ease of use with data science utilities such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/); new endpoints to query for clustering results together for 'generous' data overviews; different response types allowing for a quick start in exploring the data, and countable other features large and small documented through this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural heritage data can be complex to explore, every aspect of an objects' history can be a world in itself to discover, which can make it hard to find a starting point when first looking into the data (with or without an objective in mind). While this guide provides an overview of using the API, you may find some worked examples helpful, so we have provided some [Data Explorations](https://developers.vam.ac.uk/notebooks/) on topics such as water lilies, machines in the C18th and the ladies of Edinburgh (from 1865 to 1880 only).

For the most common usage (retrieve an object record, query all object records, etc) we provide a {ref}`quick-start:top` guide which gives code examples that can be re-used in your own project, the following sections provide  exhaustive details on the available endpoints and parameters:\n",

If you have a project where you want to look at larger sets of our object records, please log an PR detailing your project in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanda/etc-docs/) and we will get in touch if we can help out."
