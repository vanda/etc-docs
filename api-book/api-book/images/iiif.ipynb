    " The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) standardises the retrieval of images ([Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/) allowing for common image operations such as the generation of derivative/scaled images, rotation of images, tiling of images, etc; and the presentation of images ([Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/) which allows for common viewing experiences to be easily built such as page turning, slideshows, stacked images, etc.\n",

    "To make use of both APIs, you will need the identifier for the image (for the Image API) or the object (for the Presentation API). You can find these by using  {ref}`filtering:top` or {ref}`searching:top` to search for objects, in the responses you will see the systemNumber (for object identifiers) and image asset identifiers (there are also some example IIIF links in some responses to provide a shortcut to retrieve a thumbnail image).\n",
