    "As we can see from the results, there are many more records using the term 'Jet' anywhere within the record than are found by searching specifically on the field for material or technique or filtering on the identifier for the material.  This could be for a few different reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * Some of the matches on the general search for the term 'Jet' are using it with other meanings, such as Jet Engine, Design for Jet Jewellery. These might be irrelvant to your search for objects made of Jet (although possibly the designs might also be of interest)\n",
    "  * Some objects which are made of Jet have object records that have not been extensively catalogued, but they do mention in another (free-text) fields the object is made of Jet. These objects would be excluded from your search only on material and technique field, or filtering on the identifer for Jet (AAT45514)\n",
    "  * Some objects could be made from a sub-type of Jet. These would not be found by filtering on Jet (AAT45514), as the identifier used would not match. For this to work (which is a planned future enhancement to the API), we would need some form of hierarchical filtering to enable matching on a type (Jet) and all its sub-types.\n",

    "So, in summary, while filtering on the identifier (the last query we ran) will provide the most precise results, it is more than likely to not return *all* relevant results.  Keep this in mind when you use filtering, that although the number returned gives the appearance of an exact count (e.g. the V&A holds a certain number of objects made of Jet), you should also compare this result with the other searches (using 'q' and 'q_material_techniques'), to see if there are other objects not yet catalogued as extensively that would also match. As cataloguing is a never ending endeavour, this number is always likely to change over time."

For example if you want to filter on objects made in Manchester, do a search (or place search 'q_place') on 'Manchester' and look through the returned object records for the place identifier for Manchester, then query again filtering this time on that identifier (x28993 in case you wondered)\n",

    "You might be thinking another way to exactly specify multiple filters is to provide support for the {ref}`boolean:top` boolean operators available to search parameters within a filter parameter. For example using id_person=\"A6630|A6631\" to indicate you want object records mentioning either A6630 or A6631 or both of them. You might also think you could further extend this to even more complex filtering by using boolean operators in multiple parameters (id_person, id_material, etc); to specify the way you want filters to be combined (e.g. applying boolean AND between fields ('narrowing') and boolean OR within a repeating field ('broadening'), except for the materials field where boolean negation applies, except for material type silver which must be present on all matching object records. You would rightly think this would then provide you with a more granular way to control the search mode, per field instead of forcing them all to be \"broad\" or \"narrow\" combinations as the \"search_mode\" parameter does at present.\n",
